# Note for Rabobank version of cf-mgmt
[![Test, Build and Release](https://github.com/rabobank/cf-mgmt/actions/workflows/test-build-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rabobank/cf-mgmt/actions/workflows/test-build-release.yml)

This version of cf-mgmt is a fork of the cf-mgmt tool created by vmware/tanzu. The original tool can be found here: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu-labs/cf-mgmt

This Rabobank version adds support for groups maintained in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), instead of in AD (LDAP)

Documentation is only amended for as far as the Azure AD support. You may find inconsistencies with the original documentation.

In short:
* ```The cf-mgmt update-org-users``` and ```cf-mgmt update-space-users``` commands have extra parameters to specify the required information for accessing Azure AD.
* A new yaml file ```azureAD.yml``` can optionally be added to specify the Azure AD config parameters
* the files ```orgConfig.yml``` and ```spaceConfig.yml``` can now have entries for ```aad_groups``` (comparable to the corresponding ldap entrie. aad_group is not supported)
* the ```cf-mgmt-config``` command also generates the ```azureAD.yml``` file and ```aad_groups``` entries

# Cloud Foundry Management (cf-mgmt)

Go automation for managing orgs, spaces, users (from ldap groups or internal store) mapping to roles, quotas, application security groups and private-domains that can be driven from concourse pipeline and GIT managed metadata

## New Major Release Information

There has been major refactoring to internals of cf-mgmt to remove duplicate code that is not supported by go-cfclient library.  This release SHOULD be backward compatible but wanting to make community aware of a major change.  This will be released as the latest tag on dockerhub.  If you experience any problems you can revert your cf-mgmt to use the previously released version with tag `0.0.91`.

This can be done by modifying you cf-mgmt.yml concourse task with the following:

```yml
---
platform: linux

image_resource:
  type: docker-image
  source: {repository: pivotalservices/cf-mgmt, tag: "0.0.91"}

inputs:
  - name: config-repo

run:
  path: config-repo/ci/tasks/cf-mgmt.sh
```

## Overview

The __cf-mgmt__ tool is composed by 2 CLIs, `cf-mgmt` and `cf-mgmt-config`, providing the features to declarativelly manage orgs, spaces, users mapping to roles, quotas, application security groups and private-domains.

- __cf-mgmt-config__ CLI is resposible for creating the configuration files that represent the desired state of your foundation and provides the set of commands for you to manage this configuration.

- __cf-mgmt__ CLI is resposible to apply the configuration generated by `cf-mgmt-config` tool to the foundation. It provides commands to apply the config as a whole or only parts of it.

### Concourse

A common use of `cf-mgmt` is to generate a Concourse pipeline that apply the configuration generated by `cf-mgmt-config` to a foundation. This is done by using a git repository as a resouce for the configuration and having the pipeline to read from there and apply the changes. `cf-mgmt` provides a command to generate this pipeline. See more at the [Gettting Started](#getting-started) section below.

### Export Configuration

If there's already a configured foundation that you want to start using cf-mgmt on, `cf-mgmt export-config` command will export the current foundation configs and generate the files for cf-mgmt usage. See more in the [docs](docs/export-config/README.md).

## Getting Started

### Install

Compiled [releases](https://github.com/vmwarepivotallabs/cf-mgmt/releases) are available on Github.
Download the binary for your platform and place it somewhere on your path.
Don't forget to `chmod +x` the file on Linux and macOS.

### Create UAA Client

cf-mgmt needs a uaa client to be able to interact with cloud controller and uaa for create, updating, deleting, and listing entities.

To create a non-admin client execute the following command with [Cloud Foundry UAA Client](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac).  Recent addition of 2 authorities needed to setup shared domains with tcp routing `routing.router_groups.read`

```sh
uaac target uaa.<system-domain>
uaac token client get <adminuserid> -s <admin-client-secret>

uaac client add cf-mgmt \
  --name cf-mgmt \
  --secret <cf-mgmt-secret> \
  --authorized_grant_types client_credentials,refresh_token \
  --authorities cloud_controller.admin,scim.read,scim.write,routing.router_groups.read
```

Or with the [golang-based UAA CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/uaa-cli):

`go install github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/uaa-cli`

```sh
uaa-cli target https://uaa.<system-domain>

uaa-cli get-client-credentials-token <adminuserid> -s <admin-client-secret>

uaa-cli create-client cf-mgmt \
  --client_secret <cf-mgmt-secret> \
  --authorized_grant_types client_credentials,refresh_token \
  --authorities cloud_controller.admin,scim.read,scim.write,routing.router_groups.read
```

### Setup Configuration

Navigate into a directory in which will become your git repository for cf-mgmt configuration

1. Initialize git repository by either cloning a remote or using `git init`

    - This git repository is going to be used as a place to store the config files and will be consumed by a Concourse Pipeline. You should not push your `vars.yml` file or any other files with secrets to this repo.

2. Create initial configuration files. You can either setup your configuration by using `init` command or `export-config` if you want to start managing a foundation that already have some workspace setup:

   - [init](docs/config/init/README.md) command from `cf-mgmt-config` if you are wanting to start with a blank configuration and add the config using `cf-mgmt-config` operations
   - [export-config](docs/export-config/README.md) command from `cf-mgmt` if you have an existing foundation you can use this to reverse engineer your configuration.

> By default, `cf-mgmt` has the `enable-delete-orgs` option set to `false` to avoid unintentional deletions. If you'd like to have `cf-mgmt` handle deletion of orgs as well, please double check the list of `protected-orgs` and update the `enable-delete-orgs` flag to true in the `orgs.yml` of your config repository.
> You can also modify these settings using the [`cf-mgmt-config update-orgs` command](docs/config/update-orgs/README.md).

> Check the [config docs](docs/config/README.md#global-config) to understand the configuration files structure

3. *(optional)* Configure LDAP/SAML Options. If your foundation uses LDAP and/or SAML, you will need to configure ldap.yml with the correct values.

   - [LDAP only config](docs/config/README.md#ldap-configuration)
   - [SAML with LDAP groups](docs/config/README.md#saml-configuration-with-ldap-group-lookups)
   - [SAML with Azure AD groups](docs/config/README.md#saml-configuration-with-azure-active-directory-group-lookups)
   - [SAML only](docs/config/README.md#saml-configuration)

4. [Generate the concourse pipeline](docs/config/generate-concourse-pipeline/README.md) using `cf-mgmt-config`
    - ```cf-mgmt-config [OPTIONS] generate-concourse-pipeline [generate-concourse-pipeline-OPTIONS]```

5. Make sure you __.gitingore the vars.yml__ file that is generated: `echo vars.yml >> .gitignore`

6. Update your `vars.yml` file with your config git repo info, domains and the UAA client info you created in the [previous section](#create-uaa-client).
    - Use the UAA Client name as `user_id`

7. Commit and push your changes to your git repository.
    - After you `fly` the pipeline in the next step, the pipeline will observe this repository and start a new run everytime you push new configurations to the repository.

8. fly your pipeline after you have filled in vars.yml

```sh
fly -t <targetname> login -c <concourse_instance>
fly -t <targetname> set-pipeline -p <pipeline_name> \
   -c pipeline.yml \
   -l vars.yml \
   --var "ldap_password=<ldap_password>" \
   --var "client_secret=<client_secret>" \
   --var "password=<org/space_admin_password>"
```

>Check the [Concourse docs](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html) if not familiar with the `fly` CLI

9. Look for your new Pipeline in your Concourse console. If everything was properly configured all tasks of your pipeline should execute successfully.

>You now have a Pipeline ready to apply configuration changes to your foundation. Explore the [docs](docs/config/README.md) to learn the available commands in `cf-mgmt-config`, try creating new workspace configs, then commit and push the files to you git repository. Your pipeline should kick in and apply the changes.

## Support

cf-mgmt is a community supported cloud foundry add-on.  Opening issues for questions, feature requests and/or bugs is the best path to getting "support".  We strive to be active in keeping this tool working and meeting your needs in a timely fashion.

### Install Binary

Compiled releases are available on Github.
Download the binary for your platform and place it somewhere on your path.
Don't forget to `chmod +x` the file on Linux and macOS.

Alternatively, you may wish to build from source.

### Debug Output

When opening an issue please provide debug level output (scrubbed for any customer info) by using latest generated pipeline and setting LOG_LEVEL: debug or modifying current pipeline if you are not using latest pipeline to add the following to specific job step params

```yml
params:
  LOG_LEVEL: debug
   ... existing params
```

## Development

### Build from the source

`cf-mgmt` is written in [Go](https://golang.org/).
To build the binary yourself, follow these steps:

- Install `Go`.
- Clone the repo
- Build:
  - `cd cf-mgmt`
  - `go build -o cf-mgmt cmd/cf-mgmt/main.go`
  - `go build -o cf-mgmt-config cmd/cf-mgmt-config/main.go`

To cross compile, set the `$GOOS` and `$GOARCH` environment variables.
For example: `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build`.

### Testing

To run the unit tests, use `go test ./...`.

### SSH configuration
In order to use the key `allow-ssh-until` in your space config, you must set
your `allow-ssh` to false. `cf-mgmt` treats a null value differently than false.

#### Integration tests

There are integration tests that require some additional configuration.

The LDAP tests require an LDAP server, which can be started with Docker:

```docker
docker pull cwashburn/ldap
docker run -d -p 389:389 --name ldap -t cwashburn/ldap
RUN_LDAP_TESTS=true go test ./ldap_integration/...
```

The remaining integration tests require [PCF Dev](https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev)
to be running, the CF CLI, and the [UAA CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/uaa-cli).

```sh
cf dev start
uaa-cli target https://uaa.dev.cfdev.sh -k

uaa-cli get-client-credentials-token admin -s admin-client-secret

uaa-cli create-client cf-mgmt \
  --client_secret cf-mgmt-secret \
  --authorized_grant_types client_credentials,refresh_token \
  --authorities cloud_controller.admin,scim.read,scim.write,routing.router_groups.read
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true go test ./integration/...
```

### Code Generation

Some portions of this code are autogenerated.
To regenerate run `go generate ./...` from the project directory, or `go generate .` from a specific directory.
